This is a solution to the [URL Shortener Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice) backend certification project from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

## Overview

### The Challenge

User Stories

- You can POST a URL to /api/shorturl and get a JSON response with original_url and short_url properties. Here's an example: { original_url : 'https://freeCodeCamp.org', short_url : 1}.
- When you visit /api/shorturl/<short_url>, you will be redirected to the original URL.
- If you pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain { error: 'invalid url' }.

## My Process

### Built With

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com)

### What I Learned

- Working with JavaScript arrays and objects.
- Working with regex expressions and its functions such as replace().
- Working with requests created using HTML forms, which are POST requests.
- Working with results generated from the POST methods.
- Working with res.redirect().
- Working with try...catch block.

### Continued Development

I will be focussing more on the basic level JavaScript and its various functions, because this project really taught how the basic and fundamental functions can help.
